## *What is the usage of Openbox?*

*Openbox is a highly configurable, next generation window manager with extensive standards support.*

*Openbox lets you bring the latest applications outside of a full desktop environment. Most modern applications have been written with GNOME and KDE in mind. With support for the latest freedesktop.org standards, as well as careful adherence to previous standards, Openbox provides an environment where applications work the way they were designed to.*

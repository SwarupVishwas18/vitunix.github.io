# **Introduction to VITUNIX**

**‘vitunix’** is a lightweight Linux Distribution which comes preinstalled with
window managers, specifically with ‘bspwm’ and Open Box.

Since it is being created specially for developers, it contains a minimalist
GUI (Graphical User Interface), and hence it saves RAM to a great extent,
and at the same time, it is as powerful as other operating systems.

On boot, ‘vitunix’ needs only 300-400 mb of RAM. Not only this,
‘vitunix’ comes with two kernels, would help developers switch between
kernels to experiment with their projects.

Moreover, this Linux distribution is a FOSS (Free and Open Source
Software), so the entire source code is available publicly, which makes it
highly customizable and collaborative
